This is the codebase for my dungeon crawler program.

The program is a game on the commandline, where the player journeys through a 2d map defeating monsters, collecting coins and going to the exit.

The user starts by entering: ``` load Simple.map ``` to load the map for the dungeon.
And then enters: ``` play ``` to start their adventure.

The user controls their character by using the WASD keys on their keyboard.

The elements on the map represent:
 @ = The player
 X = The exit
 - = The floor
 # = Walls
 C = Coins to collect
 M = Monsters to defeat
